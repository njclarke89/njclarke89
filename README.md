- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @njclarke89
- ğŸ‘€ I fiddle about with things I don't understand and often break them. Sometimes in the course of this I build simple web apps, twitter bots and games. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of things. Particularly things to do with web development using javascipt and html.
